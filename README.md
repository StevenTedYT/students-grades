# Student Grades Prediction - Machine Learning Project

This is a small training project as part of my machine learning journey. The goal is to predict students' final grades using a machine learning model.

The current model is based on **linear regression**, but I plan to experiment with other techniques in the future.

## Dataset

The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance), containing features related to student demographics, school data, and social factors.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/StevenTedYT/students-grades.git
    ```

2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the project:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
